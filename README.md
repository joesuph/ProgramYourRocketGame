# Rocket Programmer

This is a game built in the **Unity** engine with **C#**. It is a two player game that assigns a tank to program to each player. On the players turn, a terminal appears where they must type in a script to help their rocket navigate through the terrain to hit the other player. The syntax for the player's scripts are written with one statement on each line. 

The syntax for each line are as follows:
  1. The first word, either left or right, describes toward what direction you would like to adjust the angle of the rocket by.
  2. The second word is the measure of the angle in degrees that you would like the rocket to sway towards
  3. The third word is the amount of time, you would like the missle to continue it's path before moving onto the next instruction
